The Tag
The final type of object you will find in a Git database is the tag.
This is an object that provides a permanent shorthand name for a particular commit.
It contains an object, type, tag, tagger and a message.
Normally the type is commit and the object is the SHA-1 of the commit you’re tagging.
The tag can also be GPG signed, providing cryptographic integrity to a release or version.
We’ll talk a little bit more about tags and how they differ from branches
(which also point to commits, but are not stored as objects)
in the next section,
where we’ll pull all of this together into how all these objects relate to each other conceptually.

Getting a Git Repository
There are two major ways you will get a Git repository
– you will either clone an existing project, or you will initialize a new one.
New Repositories
To create a new Git repository somewhere,
simply go to the directory you want to add version control to and type:
git init
This will create a .git directory in your current working directory that is entirely empty.
If you have existing files you want to add to your new repository, type:
git add .
git commit -m ‘my first commit’
This will add all of your current files into your new repository and index and then create your first commit object,
pointing your new master branch to it.
Congratulations, you have now added your source code to Git.

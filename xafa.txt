Git Object Types
Git objects are the actual data of Git,
the main thing that the repository is made up of.
There are four main object types in Git,
the first three being the most important to really understand the main functions of Git.
All of these types of objects are stored in the Git Object Database,
which is kept in the Git Directory.

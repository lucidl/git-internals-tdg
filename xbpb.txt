Possible Workflows
The idea of having multiple remote repositories
that you can push to and/or pull from is probably new to you,
and many people have a hard time figuring out what their workflow should look like,
especially if they are moving from a centralized SCM system.
I will present a couple of possible workflows that I have seen,
so you can determine what will work best for you and your team.
Most of these are simply a matter of convention,
not even configuration.
Each of the models can pretty easily change to another with minimal configuration changes
– maybe some permissions tweaked here or there.
central repository model
There is a single repository that all developers push to and pull from.
This model works just like a centralized SCM and Git can work that way just fine.
If you setup a repository for your team on a server that everyone has SSH or NFS access to,
Git can very easily function as a centralized repository.
This may be common on small teams with non-public projects where you don’t want to worry about a hierarchy
– the strength of this model is that it forces everyone to stay up to date with each other and it doesn’t depend on a single role.
Even large teams could use this,
but in general there are a lot of gains to be made in larger teams with a different or hybrid model.

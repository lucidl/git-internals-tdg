The Tree
Directories in Git basically correspond to trees.
A tree is a simple list of trees and blobs that the tree contains,
along with the names and modes of those trees and blobs.
The contents section of a tree object consists of a very simple text file that
lists the mode, type, name and sha of each entry.

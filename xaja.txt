An Example
Lets look at an example of simple usage of Git and which objects are stored in the Git object database as we go.
To begin with, we commit an initial tree of three files and two subdirectories, each directory with one file in it.
Possibly something like this:
When we first commit this tree, our Git model may look something like this:
We have three trees,
three blobs
and a HEAD single commit that points to the top of the tree.
The current branch points to our branch last commit
and the HEAD file points to the branch we’re currently on.
This lets Git know which commit will be the parent commit for the next commit.
Now let’s assume that we change the tree lib/base/base_include.rb file and commit again.
At this point, a new blob is added, which changes the tree that tree blob points to it,
which changes the tree that points to that tree and
so on to the top of the entire directory.
Then a new commit object is added which points to its parent tree blob and the new tree,
then the branch reference is moved forward.
Let’s also say at this point we tag this commit as a release,
which adds a new tag object.
At this point, we’ll have the following in Git:

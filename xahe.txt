If I commit a second time, the commit object will look more like this:
Notice how the parent in that commit is the same SHA-1 value of the last commit we did?
Most times a commit will only have a single parent like that,
but if you merge two branches,
the next commit will point to both of them.
The current record for number of commit parents in the Linux kernel is 12 branches merged in a single commit!

Pushing
Now we can get updates from other repositories,
but how can we push changes to them?
If we have commit rights on the repository (normally over SSH),
we can simply run git push.
$ git push origin master
The ‘origin’ in that case will be inferred if you leave it out,
but if you’ve used a different name for your remote
or you are trying to push one of your other branches,
you can do that, too.
$ git push scott-public experimental
If you don’t specify a branch,
it will infer that you want to push every branch that you and the server have in common.
So, if you have pushed your ‘master’ branch and your ‘experimental’ branch to the ‘scott-public’ server at any point,
running this will update the server to have the newest versions of both of them:
$ git push scott-public
Whereas this will only update the ‘master’ branch:
$ git push scott-public master
In Git, the opposite of ‘push’ is not ‘pull’, but ‘fetch’.
A ‘pull’ is a ‘fetch’ and then a ‘merge’.

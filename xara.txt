Backup Tool
Let’s suppose that you want to build something like a distributed Time Machine™ backup system (Apple all rights reserved)
that efficiently packs up its backups and transfers them to multiple machines.
I’m hoping by now that you could see the benefits of using the Git toolkit to accomplish this,
but this particular problem is interesting because of something that Git doesn’t do,
which is permissions.
Git stores the mode of its content in the tree,
but it doesn’t store any permissions data,
which means it’s not good for backing up directories in which permissions are important.
A good example would be the /etc directory on a Unix machine.
One project that has tackled this is Gibak
(http://eigenclass.org/hiki/gibak-backup-system-introduction).
It implements a metastore in OCaml and it’s worth a look if this topic interests you.
If you are interested in using Git in a non-standard way and plan to use Ruby,
you might be interested in my git gem
(http://jointheconversation.org/rubygit),
which provides an object oriented interface in Ruby to the Git tools,
including several of the lower level functions.

git/config
This is the main Git configuration file.
It keeps your project specific Git options,
such as your remotes, push configurations, tracking branches and more.
Your configuration will be loaded first from this file, then from a ~/.gitconfig file and then from an /etc/gitconfig file, if they exist.
Here is an example of what a config file might look like:
See the git-config
(http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html)
docs for more information on available configuration options.

Generating Patch Files
The default output of the ‘git diff’ command is a valid patch file.
If you pipe the output into a file and email it to someone,
they can apply it with the ‘patch’ command.
If you’ve done some work off of a project in an ‘experiment’ branch,
you could create a patch file this way:
$ git diff master..experiment > experiment.patch
You can then email that file to anyone,
who could apply it with the ‘-p1’ argument:
$ patch -p1 < ~/experiment.patch

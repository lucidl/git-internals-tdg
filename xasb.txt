Cloning a Repository
Many times you will be cloning a repository, however.
This means that you are creating a complete copy of another repo,
including all of its history and published branches.
A clone is, for all intents and purposes, a full backup.
If the server that you cloned from has a hard disk failure or something equally catastrophic,
you can basically take any of the clones and stick it back up there when the server is restored without anyone really the worse for wear.
In order to do this, you simply need a URL that has a Git repository hosted there,
which can be over HTTP, HTTPS, SSH or the special git protocol.
We will use the public hosted repository of the simple library I mentioned at the beginning of the book.
git clone git://github.com/schacon/simplegit.git
This will by default create a new directory called simplegit and do an initial checkout of the master branch.
If you want to put it in a different directory than the name of the project,
you can specify that on the command line, too.
git clone git://github.com/schacon/simplegit.git my_directory
â€¢ git clone (http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html)

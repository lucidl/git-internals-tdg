The Care and Feeding of Git
Git requires a bit of tender loving care from time to time.
It may seem a bit odd,
but occasionally you should run a few commands on your repositories to make sure they’re healthy and running as quickly as possible.
garbage collection
The ‘git gc’ command is an important one to remember.
It will pack up your objects into the delta-compressed format,
saving you a lot of space and seriously speeding up several commands.
$ git gc
If can turn gc’ing automatically on and off by setting a configuration setting to ‘1’ or ‘0’:
$ git config --global gc.auto 1
This will make git automatically gc itself occasionally.
You may want to setup a cron to do this at night,
however, as it can take a while sometimes on really large repositories.
fsck and prune
If you want to check the health of your repository,
you can run ‘git fsck’,
which will tell you if you have any unreachable or corrupted objects
in your database and help you fix them.
$ git fsck
Which you can then remove with ‘git-prune’
(you can run it with ‘-n’ first to see what it will do)
$ git prune -n

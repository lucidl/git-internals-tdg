Graphical Interfaces
There are two major graphical interfaces that come with Git as tools to browse the repository.
gitk
A very popular choice for browsing Git repositories is the Tcl/Tk based browser called gitk.
If you want to see a simple visualization of your repository,
gitk is a great tool.
Gitk will also take most of the same arguments that git log will take,
including —since, —until, —max-count, revision ranges and path limiters.
One of the most interesting visualizations that I regularly use is gitk—all,
which will show all of your branches next to each other
(rather than just the one you are currently on).

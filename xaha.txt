The Blob
In Git, the contents of files are stored as blobs.
It is important to note that it is the contents that are stored, not the files.
The names and modes of the files are not stored with the blob, just the contents.
This means that if you have two files anywhere in your project that are exactly the same,
even if they have different names,
Git will only store the blob once.
This also means that during repository transfers,
such as clones or fetches,
Git will only transfer the blob once,
then expand it out into multiple files upon checkout.

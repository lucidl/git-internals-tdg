dictator and lieutenant model
This is a highly hierarchical model where one individual has commit rights to a blessed repository
that everyone else fetches from.
Changes are fetched from developers by lieutenants responsible for specific subsystems and merged and tested.
Lieutenant branches are then fetched by the dictator and merged and pushed into the blessed repository,
where the cycle starts over again.
This is a model something like the Linux kernel uses,
Linus being the benevolent dictator.
This model is much better for large teams,
and can be implemented with multiple and varied levels of lieutenants and sub-lieutenants in charge of various subsystems.
At any stage in this process,
patches or commits can be rejected
â€“ not merged in and sent up the chain.

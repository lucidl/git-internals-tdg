Exporting Git
If you want to create a release of your code,
or provide some poor non-git user with a snapshot of just a specific tree,
you can use the git-archive command.
‘git-archive’ used to be called ‘git-tar-tree’,
in case you ever see that command around in older articles.
You can create the archive in either ‘tar’ or ‘zip’ formats,
the default being ‘tar’.
You can use the ‘—prefix’ argument to determine what directory,
if any, the files are expanded into.
To create a gzipped tar-ball,
you’ll have to pipe the output through ‘gzip’ first.
$ git-archive --prefix=simplegit/ v0.1 | gzip > simple-git-0.1.tgz
Then, if you email that tarball to someone,
they would get this when they opened it:
$ tar zxpvf simple-git-0.1.tgz
You can also archive parts of your project.
This command will create a zip file of just the ‘lib’ directory
of the first parent of your master branch
that will expand out into the current directory:
$ git-archive --format=zip master^ lib/ > simple-git-lib.zip
Which will unzip like this:
$ unzip simple-git-lib.zip

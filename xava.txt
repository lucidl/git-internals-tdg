Log – the Commit History
So, now we have all this history in our Git repository.
So what?
What can we do with it?
How can we see this history?
The answer is the very powerful git log command.
The log command can show you nearly anything you want to know about your commit history.
Also, since the entire history is stored locally,
it’s really fast compared with most other SCM systems,
especially if your repository is packed
(see the “Care and Feeding” section).
If you just run git log, you will get output like this:
This will show you the SHA-1 of each commit,
the committer and date of the commit,
and the full message,
starting from the last commit on your current branch and going backward in reverse chronological order
(so if there are multiple parents, it just squishes them together, interleaving the commits ordered by date)

Normal Workflow Examples
Now that we have our repository, let’s go through some normal workflow examples of a single person developing.
normal workflow screencast
The second screencast we’ve provided is Normal Workflow in Git,
which demonstrates how to setup your .gitignore file,
how to use and interpret git status output,
how to add and remove files from your index,
how to commit and what git does in the object database during these operations.
Ignoring
First off, we will often want Git to automatically ignore certain files
– often ones that are automatically generated during our development.
For example,
in Rails development we often want to ignore the log files,
the production specific configuration files, etc.
To do this, we can add patterns into the .gitignore file to tell Git that we don’t want it to track them.
Here is an example .gitignore file.

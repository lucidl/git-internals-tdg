Each object is compressed (with Zlib) and
referenced by the SHA-1 value of its contents plus a small header.
In the examples,
I will use the first 6 characters of the SHA-1 for simplicity,
but the actual value is 40 characters long.
SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm.
A SHA creates an identifier of fixed length that uniquely identifies a specific piece of content.
SHA-1 succeeded SHA-0 and is the most commonly used algorithm.
Wikipedia (http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1) has more on the topic.

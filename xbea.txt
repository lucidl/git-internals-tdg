Simple Merging
So now we want to move the changes in our newfunc branch back into our master branch and remove it.
This will require us merging one branch into another.
Since we’re already in our master branch,
we’ll merge in the newfunc branch like this:
$ git merge newfunc
Easy peasy.
We can see that the simplegit.rb file now has four new lines and the README file was auto-merged.
Now we can get rid of our ‘newfunc’ branch with a simple:
$ git branch -d newfunc
